Let's go to login page and try some details and capture the request in burpsuite

here we can see a post request captured in this burp let's send this to repeater and play with some parameters

from the request 

`csrf=HsLJjSGkCiFEw8OYoi4IjOfa8mV2lQlv`:
    - `csrf` stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery token. It's a security token used to prevent CSRF attacks.
    - The value `HsLJjSGkCiFEw8OYoi4IjOfa8mV2lQlv` is the actual CSRF token. It's a random, unique value generated by the web application to validate requests.

anyway so if we use username as administrator and comment out the password part we can login basically our payload is

SELECT USERNAME FROM users WHERE username ='administrator'-- and PASSOWRD = 'admin'

let's give this username and password to login page and boom!!
